# Tech Emporium üõí

A web application for an e-commerce storefront, built with a modern frontend stack. This project simulates an electronics store, allowing users to browse products, view detailed information, and manage a functional shopping cart.

The primary goal of this project was to practice API integration, global state management, and navigation in a Single Page Application (SPA).

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Product Showcase:** Fetches and displays a list of products from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).
* **Detailed Product Pages:** Dynamic routing to a dedicated page for each product with complete information.
* **Functional Shopping Cart:** Add and remove items from the cart. The state is managed globally and persists across all pages.
* **Live Item Counter:** The header displays the total quantity of items in the cart in real-time.
* **Seamless Navigation:** Uses `react-router-dom` for a smooth SPA experience with no page reloads.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

This project was built using a modern set of tools for frontend development:

* **React:** A library for building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and code robustness.
* **Vite:** A blazing-fast build tool for the development environment.
* **Zustand:** A minimalist and powerful global state manager for the shopping cart.
* **React Router DOM:** For implementing routes and navigation.
* **Axios:** An HTTP client for making API requests.
* **CSS Modules:** For component-scoped and conflict-free styling.
